This is a custom Gradle [build cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html)
implementation which uses [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store the cache objects.


## Compatibility

* Version >= 0.3.0 - Gradle 4.x
* Version < 0.3.0 - Gradle 3.5

## Use in your project

Please note that this plugin is not yet ready for production. Feedback though is very welcome.
Please open an [issue](https://github.com/myniva/gradle-s3-build-cache/issues) if you find a bug or 
have an idea for an improvement.


### Apply plugin

The Gradle build cache needs to be configured on the Settings level. As a first step, add a
dependency to the plugin to your `settings.gradle` file:

```
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "gradle.plugin.ch.myniva.gradle:s3-build-cache:0.1.0"
  }
}
```

### Configuration

The AWS S3 build cache implementation requires two configuration options:

| Configuration Key | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| region | The AWS region the S3 bucket is located in. |
| bucket | The name of the AWS S3 bucket where cache objects should be stored. |
| reducedRedundancy | Whether or not to use [reduced redundancy](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/reduced-redundancy/). Enabled by default. |


The `buildCache` configuration block might look like this:

```
 apply plugin: 'ch.myniva.s3-build-cache'
 
 ext.isCiServer = System.getenv().containsKey("CI")
 
 buildCache {
     local {
         enabled = !isCiServer
     }
     remote(ch.myniva.gradle.caching.s3.AwsS3BuildCache) {
         region = 'eu-west-1'
         bucket = 'your-bucket'
         push = isCiServer
     }
 }

```

More details about configuring the Gradle build cache can be found in the
[official Gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html#sec:build_cache_configure).


### AWS credentials

The plugin uses the [`DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html)
to look up the AWS credentials.


### Run build with build cache

The Gradle build cache is an incubating feature and needs to be enabled per build (`--build-cache`)
or in the Gradle properties (`org.gradle.caching=true`).

Example:

```
$> gradle --build-cache assemble
Build cache is an incubating feature.
Using AWS S3 Build Cache (your-bucket) as remote build cache, push is enabled.
```
